# "Is this worth my time" - Mini-App
**Is This Worth My Time?** — A minimalist, no-frills decision filter to stop saying “yes” out of guilt or FOMO. Log your choices in one click, track patterns over time, and reclaim your focus—one intentional “no” at a time. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No backend.

**A minimalist decision filter to stop saying “yes” when you mean “no.”**

“I’ll just do it.”
…then you feel drained.

“Is this worth my time?”
…then you choose wisely. 

This is a simple, private tool to help you pause before committing — and start making decisions that align with your energy, goals, and boundaries.

**How It Works:** 

Open the app.

**Answer 3 quick questions:**
- Will this move me closer to my goal?
- Will I feel energized or drained doing this?
- If I say no, what would I do instead?

**Hit Save — your answer is stored locally.**
Later, review your history to spot patterns:
“I always say yes to meetings that leave me drained.”
“I’m most productive when I say no to emails before 10am.”
No accounts. No cloud. No distractions. Just you and your truth.

**Why It Matters**
Most productivity tools tell you how to do more.
This one asks: Should you do this at all?
